The command accepts the following flags: . | --parent — the name of the function from which the reachability will be checked; | --child — the name of the function for which reachability will be checked; | --depth — max search depth. Reachability will only be found if the function is called through no more than depth functions. Greater depth for large projects can lead to long run times; | --exclude — a comma-separated list of functions without spaces to be excluded from found paths. Thus, if the path contains a function from this list, then this path will not be displayed; | --show — show reachability paths; | -c — number of paths for output (by default: 10); | -o — offset of the first path for output (default: 0); | --json — path to the file for outputting information in the json format. | . For example: . relation func-reachability --parent \\someOtherFunc --child \\someFunc --show --depth 10 . Gives the following output: . &gt;&gt;&gt; relation func-reachability --parent \\someOtherFunc --child \\someFunc --show --depth 10 Is function \\someFunc reachable from function \\someOtherFunc: true (1 paths) Showing 1 paths out of 1 starting from 1: [(3 calls) \\someOtherFunc -&gt; \\SomeClass::Method -&gt; \\SomeClass::OtherMethod -&gt; \\someFunc] .

It also allows you to view lists of classes, interfaces, functions, methods, files and namespaces in a tabular form with the ability to sort by metrics. Let’s look at each point separately. Code metrics . PhpStats currently calculates the following metrics: . | Afferent couplings: | Efferent couplings: | Instability: | Abstractness; | Lack of Cohesion in Methods; | Lack of Cohesion in Methods 4 (or the number of connected components of the class.); | Cyclomatic Complexity; | Count of magic numbers in functions and methods; | Count fully typed methods. | . Dependency graphs . PhpStats is currently building the following dependency graphs: . | Class (or interface) dependencies; | Class (interface) extend and implementation dependencies; | Function or method dependencies; | Links within a class (or graph for the LCOM 4 metric); | Links between files (included in global and in function); | Namespace dependencies graph; | Namespace structure graph; | Function reachability graph. | . Graphviz is used to build graphs. Dependencies between symbols . PhpStats is currently analyzing the following dependencies: . | For class-class relations: . | Whether one class is extends another and vice versa; | Whether the class implements the interface or vice versa; | What methods, fields and constants are used by one class used by another and in which methods this happens. | . | For class-function relations: . | Function belong to class; | The class is used inside the function; | Used class members in functions; | The function is used in the class (+ all methods where this function is used). | . | For function-function relations: . | Functions belong to the same class; | Does the first function use the second and vice versa; | Whether the first function is reachable from the second through calls and vice versa (+ call stacks to reach the function). | . | .

PhpStats collects various quality metrics of the code, which can be used to determine the quality of the project as a whole, or, for example, of the class in particular. There is no separate command for getting metrics, since metrics are displayed in the information about the symbol. So, for example, to get the LCOM4 metric for a certain class, you need to use the info class command for which write the name of the required class. The received class information will contain a field describing the LCOM4 metric. See the detailed description of the info command here. Another option to get the value of the metrics is the list command, which will list classes, functions, etc. with all calculated metrics. See the detailed description of the list command here. ",

    "content": "PhpStats currently calculates the following metrics: . | Afferent couplings: | Efferent couplings: | Instability: | Abstractness; | Lack of Cohesion in Methods; | Lack of Cohesion in Methods 4 (or the number of connected components of the class.); | Cyclomatic Complexity; | Count of magic numbers in functions and methods; | Count fully typed methods. | . Afferent couplings (Ca) . The number of classes in other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package’s responsibility. Efferent couplings (Ce) . The number of classes in other packages that the classes in a package depend upon is an indicator of the package’s dependence on externalities. Instability (I) . The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce + Ca). I = Ce / (Ce + Ca) . This metric is an indicator of the package’s resilience to change. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a completely stable package and I=1 indicating a completely unstable package. Abstractness (A) . The ratio of the number of abstract classes in a group to the total number of classes. A = nA / nAll. | nA — the number of abstract classes in a group; | nAll — the total number of classes. | . The range for this metric is 0 to 1: . | 0 — the category is completely concrete; | 1 — the category is completely abstract. | . Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM) . The result of subtracting from one the sum of the number of methods (CM_i) that refer to a certain class field (i) for all fields, divided by the number of methods (CM) multiplied by the number of fields (CF). Lack of Cohesion in Methods 4 (LCOM4) . The number of “connected components” in a class. A connected component is a set of related methods (and class-level variables). There should be only one such a component in each class. If there are 2 or more components, the class should be split into so many smaller classes. Which methods are related? Methods a and b are related if: . | they both access the same class-level variable, or | a calls b, or b calls a. | . After determining the related methods, we draw a graph linking the related methods (use the ‘graph lcom4’ command to build the graph) to each other. LCOM4 equals the number of connected groups of methods. | LCOM4=1 indicates a cohesive class, which is the “good” class. | LCOM4&gt;=2 indicates a problem. The class should be split into so many smaller classes. | LCOM4=0 happens when there are no methods in a class. This is also a “bad” class. | . Information from https://www.aivosto.com/project/help/pm-oo-cohesion.html#LCOM4 . Cyclomatic complexity (CC) . The number of decision points. Cyclomatic complexity is basically a metric to figure out areas of code that needs more attention for the maintainability. It would be basically an input to the refactoring. It definitely gives an indication of code improvement area in terms of avoiding deep nested loop, conditions etc. The decision points is conditional statements like if, for, while, foreach, case, default, continue, break, goto, catch, ternary, coalesce, or, and. Count of magic numbers (CMN) . Magic numbers are any number in code that isn’t immediately obvious to someone with very little knowledge. Code with magic numbers is more difficult to understand and refactor, as it is not always obvious what the author meant by it. The more magic numbers, the more difficult it is to refactor the given code. Count fully typed methods (CFTM) . The number of methods in the class for which there is a type hint for each parameter, as well as the return type. ",

PhpStats allows you to see relationship between classes and methods. For example, how are the two classes related, whether they use each other’s methods and which ones. To get a relation, use the relation all command. The command accepts the following flags: . | --classes — a comma-separated list of classes without spaces for which you want to find a relationship with other classes or functions; | --funcs — a comma-separated list of functions without spaces for which you want to find a relationship with other classes or functions. | . For example: . &gt;&gt;&gt; relation all --classes='Foo,Boo' --funcs='Foo::method,someFunc' . Will output all relationships, between classes, functions and between each class and function. This extended syntax is used to easily specify a large number of symbols, however, if you only need to find relationships between two classes, then it is enough to write the following: . &gt;&gt;&gt; relation all --classes='Foo,Boo' .
